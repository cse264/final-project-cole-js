# Cash Clicker
Live Web App: http://cashclicker.herokuapp.com/

## Project Description
Cash Clicker is a simple 'clicker game' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game). To play, users must first create an account, which only take a few seconds. Once you have an account, you can start clicking on The Button to increase your cash score! Your progress is automatically saved, so you can always pick up where you left off. If you're feeling competitive, check out the leaderboard to see where you stand among other players.
